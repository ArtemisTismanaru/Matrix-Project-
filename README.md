  ### Description: 🎮 Bomberman Game Overview

👾 This Arduino-based game, inspired by the classic "Bomberman," involves navigating a player through a matrix LED display filled with walls. The player's mission is to strategically place bombs 💣 to destroy these walls while avoiding getting trapped.

🕹️ Controls

The game is controlled using a joystick and a button. The joystick allows the player to move up, down, left, and right across the matrix, while the button is used to place bombs.
📺 Display

The game uses a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) to show important game information like the timer ⏲️, score 📈, and highscore 🏆.
The LED matrix displays the game arena, including the player's position, walls, and bombs.
🎛️ Settings Menu

Players can adjust the LCD and LED matrix brightness through a settings menu, providing a personalized gaming experience.
🔊 Sound Effects

The game features sound effects like a bomb explosion sound, adding more excitement to the gameplay.
🕹️ Gameplay

The game starts with a countdown and randomly generates walls on the LED matrix.
Players move using the joystick and place bombs to destroy walls.
Each bomb explosion is timed, and players must move away quickly to avoid being "caught" in the blast.
The game keeps track of the time and score, updating these on the LCD.
🏁 End Game

The game ends when all walls are destroyed, and the score is compared to the highscore to see if a new record is set.
Players return to the main menu to start a new game or adjust settings.
👉 This Arduino project combines hardware manipulation (LCD, LED matrix, joystick) and software logic to create an engaging and interactive game experience. Enjoy the blend of strategy, quick thinking, and fun in this classic game remake! 🚀🎉
