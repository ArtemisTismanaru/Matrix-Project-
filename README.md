Introduction to Robotics: Matrix Project

  # Mini 8x8 LED Matrix Project 🎮 

  
  
  ### Task: 🎓 Unibuc Robotics Matrix Project (2023 - 2024)

  🎲 Project Objective:
  Create an engaging and fun game using a matrix display, with different requirements.

  👾 Game Requirements:

  Minimum components: LCD, joystick, buzzer, LED matrix.
  Basic sound effects are required (e.g., for eating food, dying, finishing a level).
  Each level should work on a 16x16 matrix with concepts like visibility or "rooms".
  The game should be intuitive, fun, and progressively challenging.
  🖥️ Menu Requirements:
  
  Intro Message: Display a greeting message upon powering up.
  Menu Categories:
  Start Game: Initiates the game.
  Highscore: Track and display high scores. Save the top values in EEPROM.
  Settings: Includes LCD brightness, matrix brightness, sound settings, and more. Save settings to EEPROM.
  About: Details about the game creators.
  How to Play: Provide a short, informative game description.
  In-Game Display: Show relevant info like lives, level, score, etc.
  Post-Game Screens: Display game results and check if the player beat the highscore.
  🔧 Useful Resources:
  
  LedControl library, LCD displays information, inspirational videos from previous projects.
  🎨 Creative Freedom:
  Students are encouraged to pick something they enjoy and create a game that's both fun and a showcase of their abilities. The final product should be intuitive and enjoyable for others to play.
  
  🚀 Goal:
  This project is a chance for students to demonstrate their skills in creating a complete, final project from concept to execution. It emphasizes creativity, programming, and hardware interaction skills.

  ### Description: 🎮 Bomberman Game Overview

👾 This Arduino-based game, inspired by the classic "Bomberman," involves navigating a player through a matrix LED display filled with walls. The player's mission is to strategically place bombs 💣 to destroy these walls while avoiding getting trapped.

🕹️ Controls

The game is controlled using a joystick and a button. The joystick allows the player to move up, down, left, and right across the matrix, while the button is used to place bombs.

📺 Display

The game uses a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) to show important game information like the timer ⏲️, score 📈, and highscore 🏆.
The LED matrix displays the game arena, including the player's position, walls, and bombs.

🎛️ Settings Menu

Players can adjust the LCD and LED matrix brightness through a settings menu, providing a personalized gaming experience.

🔊 Sound Effects

The game features sound effects like a bomb explosion sound, adding more excitement to the gameplay.

🕹️ Gameplay

The game starts with a countdown and randomly generates walls on the LED matrix.
Players move using the joystick and place bombs to destroy walls.
Each bomb explosion is timed, and players must move away quickly to avoid being "caught" in the blast.
The game keeps track of the time and score, updating these on the LCD.
🏁 End Game

The game ends when all walls are destroyed, and the score is compared to the highscore to see if a new record is set.
Players return to the main menu to start a new game or adjust settings.
👉 This Arduino project combines hardware manipulation (LCD, LED matrix, joystick) and software logic to create an engaging and interactive game experience. Enjoy the blend of strategy, quick thinking, and fun in this classic game remake! 🚀🎉
